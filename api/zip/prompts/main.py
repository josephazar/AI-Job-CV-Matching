generate a report for a campany called {company} that has {prompt}

------------------------------------------------------------------
here is a sample example to follow and dont copy the exact information just use it to help you write the report , the info change depends on the company:
A-	Scope
This policy applies to all regular fulltime team members of EXQUITECH and should be fairly enforced by all management and supervisory personnel.
B-	Objectives
Through implementation of this policy, Exquitech expects to:

â€¢	Ensure timely reporting and accurate recording of absences.
â€¢	Manage absences in line with contractual entitlements and operational requirements.
â€¢	Reduce the current level of unexcused absences, tardiness, and early departures.
â€¢	Identify patterns of employee absences and develop effective intervention strategies to improve team memberâ€™s attendance.
â€¢	Provide a framework for the granting and administration of leave.
â€¢	Use the vacation days as tools to ensure that sick leaves and unjustified leaves are to improve team memberâ€™s attendance.

C-	Attendance

1.	Attendance
The operating hours of the head office are from 7:00 am till 4:00pm or 8am till 5pm from Monday to Friday.

All Exquitech team members are granted paid days off on the official holidays as per the internal policies and regulations, and the Labor Law.

a-	Absence
The absence of a team member will either be accepted or not by his manager. In case the absence is justified and agreed upon by the manager, a leave request should be filled on the platform.
All absences and tardiness should be applied on the companyâ€™s platform otherwise appropriate disciplinary action will result. 
In case the absence is unjustified, it will be deducted as per the internal policy.
b-	Duty on Holidays       
When a team member is requested by his manager to work on a holiday or a day off, the team member is entitled for alternative days and will be added to his annual leaves.

c-	  Tardiness
The team member should inform his direct manager.
If justified a justification email or text message should be sent.
If the lateness is unjustified, the deduction will be done as per the internal policy.

d-	Leaves

2.	Sick Leave

a.	Absence Reporting
When a team member is absent because of the need for sick leave, he should ensure that his manager is informed at the earliest practicable time, normally no later than 30min after his scheduled start time, and should be also applied on the company platform.
Responsible notice is also required for pre-arranged sick leave, example: a surgical procedure.
If the period of leave extends over 2 days or longer, the team member will keep the manager informed at regular intervals of the situation concerning the absence from work. A medical certificate giving the reason in the likely period of expected absence is required, and it must be submitted to the company within 48 hours of the team memberâ€™s absence. Sickness during preapproved annual leave will be considered as annual leave.

b.	Work Accident
All personal work-related accidents must be reported and recorded on an accident/incident report form (insurance).
All lost time resulting from the non-work injury must also be documented.

c.	Leave Management
Each Manager will monitor and manage sick leave in a fair and equitable manner that takes account of individual circumstances. The most difficult problems to manage are often those concerning short term but persistent patterns of absenteeism, or long-term illness.
If the pattern of unsupported absence continues, the situation will be reviewed, and disciplinary action may be considered. Where the period of absence extends over a significant period and the continued ill health of an employee prevents them from carrying out their duties.
The situation will be reviewed at regular intervals and where necessary medical advice will be sought on the long-term prediction.
If the absence continues to extend over a prolonged period and is affecting operational needs, other options may need to be explored with the team member. Each case will be treated on its merits and with due regard to the medical information that is received.





3.	Annual Leave
a.	Entitlement to Annual Leave
Entitlement to Annual Leaves is prescribed in employment contracts. The annual leave balance is earned based on each countryâ€™s Labor Law.

a.	Job Protection
The company will normally hold a team memberâ€™s position open (this includes filling it temporarily). Where the company needs to fill a key position permanently, there are provisions for offering the team member on parental leave a comparable position, or, if this is not possible, approving an extension of leave until a team member previous position or similar position 
becomes vacant. The job protection applies to all leaves that are for more than 1 month and especially for senior positions.
